# Deep dive into Morpheus Tokenomics
## Introduction:
Tokenomics serves as the backbone of Web3 projects, shaping their dynamics and benefits. A journey through the evolution of tokenomics, starting with Bitcoin, reveals its pivotal role.  
Tokenomics models over time:
- **Bitcoin Era:** Bitcoin introduced decentralized currency, emphasizing scarcity and value through capped supply and Proof-of-Work.
- **Ethereum and Smart Contracts:** Ethereum expanded tokenomics, enabling programmable assets through smart contracts, leading to the tokenization trend.
- **DeFi and Governance Tokens:** Governance tokens in DeFi showcased how tokens empower users in protocol decision-making.
- **NFTs:** The rise of NFTs demonstrated the versatility of tokens beyond financial applications.
- **RWA (Real World Assets)**: Variants of tokenomics partially or fully dependent on real-world assets.

## What’s the Problem?
The significance of effective tokenomics becomes apparent when exploring the challenges posed by flawed models, impacting user engagement, project business model and long term sustainability.
Attracting and retaining users becomes a challenge because poor tokenomics discourages users from active engagement by failing to provide clear benefits or incentives and a lack of utility or tangible value diminishes project appeal. Which also leads to unreasonably high marketing costs.
Tokenomic flaws can result in economic misalignments, leading to unfair distribution of value and impacting the overall health of the ecosystem. Under such conditions, the business model stops working, jeopardizing the sustainability of the project and, as a result, endless pivoting or bankruptcy.

## Is there a way out?
Morpheus addresses these challenges through a comprehensive solution, intertwining various components that leverage MOR tokens effectively, thereby creating both internal and external demand. 
Morpheus tokenomics incorporates elements from all models: 
1. Inspired by Bitcoin, it incorporates an emission cap of 42 000 000 with gradual token release starting from 14,400 MOR per day and then declining by 2.468994701 MOR each day, until the reward reaches 0 on day 5,833 (about 16 years). This schedule is aligned with project growth and prevents excessive supply.
2. From Ethereum, it ensures transparency and strict adherence to set conditions through smart contracts.
3. Taking cues from DeFi, tokenomics allows the use of MOR tokens as an investment tool, providing rewards for contributions to project development.
4. Drawing from NFTs and RWAs, it enables MOR holders to claim a portion of network computational power daily and engage (including rewards) with other player categories for various actions.

## Techno Capital Machine tokenomics engine
Morpheus has introduced a new and novel idea called the Techno Capital Machine (TCM). It has introduced many new aspects to the way Web3 users have traditionally thought about tokenomics and open source projects launch.  
These include the following:  
1. Users (Capital providers) deposit stETH that generates yield and being rewarded in pro rata to their contributions in native token MOR.
2. The Morpheus contract then uses 50% yield to buy MOR token from AMM and pair it with the remaining 50% of the yield and deposit them into the liquidity pool.
3. Holders of the MOR tokens have access to the Morpheus` utility.  

**Techno Capital Machine has a number of advantages:**
- The user maintains custody of their principle in the yield producing asset.
- No impermanent loss risk.
- Users lost nothing, but contribute yield.
- The yield contributed daily creates a sustainable demand for the native MOR token and contributes to the AMM liquidity growth over time.
- Holders of the native token can add additional functionality to their Smart Agent.
- The whole ecosystem received essential funding for all the participants.
- Fairness. A user deposited 0,1 ETH or 1000 ETH got the same value depending on their share of the total stETH deposited pool, as each added stETH dilutes share of each Capital Provider, but at the same time increases MOR in value due to the positive impact of liquidity created. 
- Chain agnostic and Scalability. More yield generating assets can be added in future for creating multichain liquidity.
 
This way Techno Capital Machine launch provides massive benefits allowing to attract essential capital in the short term.

## Incentives for ecosystem players 
There are four categories of ecosystem players in Morpheus: 
- Capital Providers.
- Compute Providers.
- Code Providers.
- Community Builders.

The unique feature of Morpheus tokenomics is that each of these categories possesses its own intrinsic tokenomics while being part of a unified value circulation structure. 

Take **Capital Providers**, for example. In exchange for the yield generated by their assets, they receive rewards in the form of MOR tokens. They can either reinvest these tokens or keep them in their balance for settlements with other players or to access a portion of the network's computational power. Simultaneously, the value created by the Protocol owned Liquidity, as a result of interaction within the group, adds value to each participant in the overall ecosystem.

**Code Providers**, contributing to the evolution of Morpheus' code and the creation of Smart Agents, generate collective value at the protocol level. They also have the opportunity to receive rewards in MOR tokens, which they can utilize in the solutions they create.

**Compute Providers** produce the primary resource for the network, meeting the growing demand from users. In return, they have the right to a portion of the daily MOR emissions. The rewards obtained can be used to interact with one of the AI applications, such as optimizing the process of providing computations and accounting, or invested in expanding capabilities.

Morpheus has also set aside part of the MOR inflationary rewards to be set aside to **Community (apps) Builders**. These are developers that get rewards for building ways that users can more easily enter and bring value into the Morpheus ecosystem. 

The **market for users data**, paid in MOR, along with users payments or MOR purchases to increase stakes for more free network computations, is part of the economic relationships with Community Builders (creators of apps users will utilize), who rewarded in MOR tokens based on the popularity of their application.
	
Moreover,  24% emission allocation for each category of core parties establishes a healthy balance, ensuring equal conditions without dominance, fostering natural market regulation. Pricing between parties is also based on open market approaches to facilitate self-regulation of economic processes.

## Special ingredients 
Thanks to a token utility first approach, available upon holding, a significant portion of tokens will stay in wallets with no movements, increasing in value with the influx of new users. This, in turn, leads to the growth of network effects.

Long-term sustainability in tokenomics is further ensured through a fair launch, avoiding sell pressure from VCs, private investors, or those who acquired tokens through private allocations or pre-mining.

MOR burn which works similar to the burn function in Ethereum is another mechanic that ensures MOR scarcity over time.

And that's not all, there is also the icing on the cake, in the form of a protection fund, which receives 4% of all emissions and is designed to act as a stabilizer of tokenomics in case of unforeseen events.

## Conclusions
Morpheus’ tokenomics presents a holistic framework, avoiding pitfalls and built with utility in mind. By incentivizing key contributors, their interactions and maintaining fair market dynamics, it establishes Morpheus as a sustainable innovator in the decentralized realm. Openness, clarity and a fair approach are factors that will naturally attract more and more new users.
